Hello {{ name }},<br><br>

Welcome to Sarcoma Central.<br><br>

To get started, <a href="{{ login_url }}">log in</a> using your email address and password.<br><br>

You will land on your personal dashboard -- a <em>private space</em> for your content and messages. You'll see content shared with you and the groups you belong to.<br><br>

Members can view your profile. Please take time to complete the details (“edit profile” by clicking your name) -- i.e., post a brief bio, your research interests, and photo to foster interaction and trust.<br><br>

All members of Sarcoma Central are members of the <a href="{{ commons_link }}">Community Commons</a> group. You will see the latest activity on that page and a members list.<br><br>

Visit the <a href="{{ groups_link }}">All Groups</a> page and consider joining open groups or requesting access to closed groups. You can also start your own group and invite colleagues to join.<br><br>

You can start discussions and post documents, case reports, and references from your personal dashboard (<em>for sharing with multiple groups and members</em>) or from a group dashboard (<em>for interaction with that group</em>).<br><br>

Take a look at our <a href="http://www.rapidscience.org/collaboration-platform/">short video demonstrating key features</a> on the site. If you have questions or technical difficulties, or ideas regarding how the site can facilitate your work, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@rapidscience.org">support@rapidscience.org</a>.<br><br>


Sincerely,<br><br>
