Hello {{ name }},<br><br>

Welcome to Sarcoma Central.<br><br>

Upon registration at <a href="https://{{ site }}">{{ site }}</a>, you landed on your personal dashboard -- a private space for your content and messages. You'll see content shared with you and the groups you belong to.<br><br>

Members can view your profile. Please take time to complete the details (“edit profile” by clicking your name) -- i.e., post a brief bio, your research interests, and photo to foster interaction and trust.<br><br>

All members of Sarcoma Central are members of the Community Commons group. You will see the latest activity on that page and a members list.<br><br>

On the All Groups page, you can join open groups or request access to closed groups. You can also start your own group and invite colleagues to join.<br><br>

You can start discussions and post documents, case reports, and references from your personal dashboard (for sharing with multiple groups and members) or from a group dashboard (for interaction only with that group).<br><br>

Take a look at our <a href="http://www.rapidscience.org/collaboration-platform/">short video demonstrating key features</a> on the site, and see <a href="http://www.rapidscience.org/collaboration-platform/faqs/" target="_blank">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for details about joining and forming groups, posting and sharing content, security and permissions, and submitting anonymized patient data. If you have questions or technical difficulties, or ideas regarding how the site can facilitate your work, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@rapidscience.org">support@rapidscience.org</a>.<br><br>


Sincerely,<br><br>
