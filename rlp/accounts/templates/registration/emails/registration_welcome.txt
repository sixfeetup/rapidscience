Welcome to Sarcoma Central.<br><br>

Upon logging in, you will have landed on your personal dashboard -- a <em>private space</em> for your content and messages.<br><br>

Members can view your profile. Please take time to complete your profile ("edit profile" by clicking your name) -- i.e., post a brief bio, your research interests, and photo to foster interaction and trust.<br><br>

All members of Sarcoma Central are registered to the <a href="{{ commons_link }}">Community Commons</a> group. You will see the members list and the latest activity on that group page.<br><br>

Other groups to which you have been invited or otherwise joined will be listed on your dashboard for easy access. Visit the <a href="{{ groups_link }}">All Groups</a> page and consider joining open groups or requesting access to closed groups. You can also start your own group and invite colleagues to join.<br><br>

You can start discussions and post documents, case reports, and references from your personal dashboard (for sharing with multiple groups and members) or from a group dashboard (for interaction with that group).<br><br>

If you have questions or technical difficulties, or ideas regarding how the site can facilitate your work, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@rapidscience.org">support@rapidscience.org</a>.<br><br>

Happy collaborating!<br><br>

Sincerely,<br><br>

The <a href="https://sarcoma.rapidscience.org/">Sarcoma Central</a> Team <a href="https://twitter.com/RapidScience/">@RapidScience</a><br><br>
