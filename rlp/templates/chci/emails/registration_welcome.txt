Welcome to Sarcoma Central.<br><br>

Upon logging in, you will have landed on your personal dashboard -- a private space for your content and messages.<br><br>

Members can view your profile. Please take time to complete your profile (“edit profile” by clicking your name) -- i.e., post a brief bio, your research interests, and photo to foster interaction and trust.<br><br>

All members of Sarcoma Central are registered to the <a href="https://{{ site.domain }}{% url 'projects:projects_list' %}1-community-commons">Community Commons</a> group. You will see the members list and the latest activity on that group page.<br><br>

Other groups to which you have been invited or otherwise joined will be listed on your dashboard for easy access. Visit the <a href="https://{{ site.domain }}{% url 'projects:projects_list' %}">All Groups</a> page and consider joining open groups or requesting access to closed groups. You can also start your own group and invite colleagues to join.<br><br>

You can start discussions and post documents, case reports, and references from your personal dashboard (for sharing with multiple groups and members) or from a group dashboard (for interaction with that group).<br><br>

If you have questions or technical difficulties, or ideas regarding how the site can facilitate your work, please contact us at <​support@rapidscience.org>.<br><br>

Happy collaborating!<br><br>

Sincerely,<br>
